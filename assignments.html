<p class="heading">Assignment Expectations and Instructions</p>

<p class="text">
There will be  weekly problem sets. Planned problem set release and the due dates are listed on the <a href="schedule.html">course schedule</a>,
the links to actual assignments will be posted on the schedule as well. Any adjustments to the due dates 
will be announced in class. Please read this page in its entirety for information about what is expected from you with
respect to the problem sets.
<br><br>
You are expected to answer all questions, except for
those labeled "optional." A good attempt at a problem, stating your approach and where you got stuck, is much better (both grade-wise
and for learning) than leaving it blank. Most problems will usually require either a proof or a counter-example.
<br><br>
<b>Written Proofs.</b> The presentation style of your proofs should be modeled on the proofs given in the textbook. The proofs we will do during lectures,
will usually be interactive and focused more on providing intuition than serving as a model for written proofs.  
Visualizations (graphs, diagrams, etc) are encouraged and are an effective methods of clarifying a concept.  However, they generally
do not themselves constitute a proof. 


<br><br>
<b>Advice on Problem Sets.</b> 
I have put together general advice on how to succeed on the problem sets, along with specific advice on writing and analyzing algorithms
and grading expectations, in this <a href="handouts/Problem_Set_Advice.pdf"> handout</a>.  Please read it careful and ask me if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<!--<p class="text">
Problems will be graded on the
correctness, clarity, thoroughness, and appropriateness of responses.
</p>

<p class="text">
Two other points worth noting: 
<ul>
<li>The proofs given in class typically have a different
apperance from those in the text, because they have an interactive, real-time
dimension. While they are (hopefully) good models of correctness and approach,
they are not intended to be stellar models of written proofs.</li>
<li>Perhaps surpisingly, even computer scientists can find repetitive language
boring over time, so we try to vary our language without sacrificing (too much)
precision.  In particular, I often replace the word "prove" with "show", "verify", "confirm", and so on. 
Also, when a problem asks that you design an algorithm to accomplish some goal, you can safely assume that you need to prove that
the algorithm is correct and to determine its time and space complexity.</li>
</ul>
</p>
-->

<p class="text">
<b>Preparation and Submission.</b> You must follow the instructions below for preparing and submitting your problem sets.
<ul>
<li> All assignments must be submitted through <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>. All students must sign up on Gradescope using the course code <b>74XDKB</b>. Gradescope
not only helps streamline the process of submission, grading and returning graded, it is also useful in implementing practices like anonymous grading.</li>
<li>
All assignments must be submitted in PDF format and must be typeset using <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. LaTeX is the most widely used tool to professionally typeset mathematical content, proofs, conference and journal papers, etc.
It is installed on all CS lab machines (both OS X and Unix) and is freely available for all major operating systems, as well as in browser-based platforms such as <a href ="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>.</li>
Resources to get stated in and master LaTeX are listed on the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.
<li> You must use the LaTeX template provided as part of each problem set. This template ensures that your PDF is handled correctly by Gradescope.</li>
<li> For figures, graphs or other illustrations, you may use any graphics generation tool of your liking. Some examples are GraphViz, Powerpoint, Keynote, Inkscape, etc. Neat and properly scanned hand drawn figures are also allowed.</li>
<li> <b> All problem sets are due at 11pm on the due date unless otherwise stated.</b></li>

</ul>
<br>
<br>

<!--br><br>
<p class="text">
<b>Why handwritten problem sets are not accepted.</b>
A large fraction of handwritten solutions, especially including mathematical content as in this course, are difficult (sometimes impossible) to read, which can dramatically increase the amount of time needed to grade them.
Secondly, handwritten problem sets make it difficult to implement anonymous grading as handwriting can often reveal the student's identity. By submitting
typeset assignment, without student information, through Gradescope, the TAs and instructor will be unlikely to know whose work they are grading.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class ="text">
<b> Sample Solutions.</b> Sample solutions to problem sets will be provided through GLOW and represent a particular approach to solving a problem; it
may not be the only (or even the best) approach.
Typically there are several ways to solve a problem and creativity is encouraged, unless the
problem states that a specific approach must be used (for example,
"Design a greedy algorithm to ..." would require that the solution be a greedy
algorithm).
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br-->






<!-- copied from main page: the  should be noted for problem sets.
Collaboration on problem-solving with other students in the course is permitted; collaborations must be clearly cited for each problem.
Each student must write up each solution on his/her own and no sources beyond
the course materials (textbook, your own class notes, other assigned readings) may be used.
In particular, this means that other students' work, or sample solutions from
any source, may not be used to aid you in solving a problem or in writing up
your solution.


<p class="text">
For programming assignments in Computer Science courses, the honor code is interpreted in very specific ways. When a program is assigned, your instructor will identify it as a "laboratory" or "team" program.
</p>

<p class="text">
<u>Laboratory Programs</u>: Laboratory programs are expected to be the work of the individual student, designed and coded by him or her alone. Help locating errors is allowed, but a student may only receive help from other students in correcting errors of syntax; help in correcting errors of logic is strictly forbidden. Guideline: Assistance from anyone other than the TAs, approved tutors, or instructors in the design or coding of program logic will be considered a violation of the honor code. 
</p>

<p class="text">
<u>Team Programs</u>: Team programs are laboratory programs that are to be worked on in teams of two or more students. You are allowed to discuss team programs with your partners, but work with others is otherwise restricted by the appropriate rules above. Guideline: Any work that is not the work of your team is considered a violation of the honor code.
